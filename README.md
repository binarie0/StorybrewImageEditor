# StorybrewImageEditor
 Edit images and generate noise for Storybrew storyboards!

## How to set up
 To set up StorybrewImageEditor, you must go into your project inside Storybrew   
 and click "Settings" -> "Referenced Assemblies" -> "Add Assembly File"    
 Then, navigate to where you download StorybrewImageEditor.dll and select it.    

 You will also need to copy StorybrewImageEditor.dll and paste it inside of   
 the Storybrew root directory (at least, that's what I had to do).   

 If you want to see the example in action, you'll need to copy it from
 your download location and into your project. Then, you'll need to add it    
 as an effect.
### Credits
 I did code compilation and making it work inside Storybrew.  
    
 The gaussian blur effect was first coded by mdymel and Gisburne2000   
 almost 7 years ago!! Link to that here: https://github.com/mdymel/superfastblur

 Also, I learned how to use Marshal.Copy as a side effect from reading   
 this article on Gaussian Noise https://epochabuse.com/gaussian-noise/
