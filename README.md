# StorybrewImageEditor
 Edit images, generate noise, create sprite groups, and more soon for Storybrew storyboards!
 This branch is for .NET 8.0, the main branch is dedicated to .NET 4.8
## How to set up
 To set up StorybrewImageEditor, you must go into your project inside Storybrew   
 and click "Settings" -> "Referenced Assemblies" -> "Add Assembly File"    
 Then, navigate to where you download SBImageLib.dll and select it.    

 You will also need to copy SBImageLib.dll and paste it inside of   
 the Storybrew root directory (at least, that's what I had to do).   

 This was used to make all of my storyboards from June 2024 onward.
 
### Credits
 I did code compilation and making it work inside Storybrew.  
    
 The gaussian blur effect was first coded by mdymel and Gisburne2000   
 almost 7 years ago!! Link to that here: https://github.com/mdymel/superfastblur

 Also, I learned how to use Marshal.Copy as a side effect from reading   
 this article on Gaussian Noise https://epochabuse.com/gaussian-noise/
